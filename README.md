# Thinktank

## Choosing hardware platform

With a port expander, we can add up to 128 GPIO Pins to a raspberry pi. That seems enough.
And, because a rbpi is more easy to develop with, it should be quite obvious to stick to it and do not use arduino.

### Available programming languages

python: The usual language to use with rbpi

javascript: Also available, but we need to make sure, all libraries are supported (but, what is not supported by javascript?)

php: erika heidi (http://www.heidislab.com/) has some articles on using php for GPIO stuff on a rbpi
